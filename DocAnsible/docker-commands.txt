Important docker commands
===============================
Docker Image commands
------------------------
1 To downlaod an image
  docker pull image_name

2 To see the list of all imagtes in our docker host
  docker images
  or
  docker image ls

3 To search for an image on hub.docker.com
  docker search image_name

4 To delete an image from our docker host
  docker rmi image_name

5 To upload a docker image
  docker push imagename

6 To create an image from a container
  docker commit container_id/container_name new_image_name

7 To create an image from a docker file
  docker build -t new_iamge_name path_of_dockerfile

Docker Container  commands
----------------------------
8 To see the list of running containers
  docker container ls

9 To see the list of all containers(running and stopped)
  docker ps -a

10 To find detailed info about a container
  docker inspect container_name/container_id

11 To see the logs generated by a container
   docker logs container_name/container_id

12 To start a stopped container
   docker start container_name/container_id

13 To stop a running container
   docker stop container_name/container_id

14 To restart a container
   docker restart container_name/container_id
   To restart after 10 seconds
   docker restart -t 10 container_name/container_id

15 To remove a stopped container
   docker rm container_name/container_id

16 To remove a running container
   docker rm -f container_name/container_id

17 To stop all running containers
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

18 To remove all stopped containers
   docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

19 To remove all containers(running and stopped)
   docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

20 To create a container from an image
   docker run image_name
   Run command options
   -------------------
   -it   Used for opening an interactive terminal in the 
         container where we can fire linux commands
   -d    Runs the container as a deamon ie it runs the container          in the background
   --name  Used for assigning a name to a container
   -p      Used for port mapping.It will link the container port            with the docker host port.Container port is called            internal port and docker host port is called external            port
           Eg: -p 8080:80 
           Here 8080 will be docker host port and 80 will be            container port
   -P     Used for automatic port mapping ie the internal port           of container will be mapped with a port on docker host           and this external port will be greater than 30000
   -v     Used for mounting volumes on a container
   --volumes-from  Used for creating reusable volumes that can                    be shared between containers
   --network   Used for assigning a network to a container
   -e      Used for assigning environment variables
   -rm    Used for removing the container on exit
   --mem   Used for allocating memory to containers
   --cpu   Used for allocating fixed amount of cpu to containers

21 To see the ports used by a container
   docker port container_name/container_id


Docker Networking commands
---------------------------------
22 To see the list of docker networks
   docker network ls

23 To create a new network
   docker network create networkname

24 To find detailed info about a network
   docker network inspect network_name/network_id

25 To delete a network
   docker network rm network_name/network_id

26 To attach a network to a running container
   docker network connect network_name/network_id 
                              container_name/container_id

27 To disconnect a network from a running container
   docker network disconnect network_name/network_id
                               container_name/container_id

28 To run a particular command in a running container
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id command_to_run
   Eg: To open bash terminal in an already running contianer
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id bash

29 To comeout of a container without exit
   ctrl+p,ctrl+q

30 To go into a container which is already runing in background
   docker attach container_name/container_id

Docker volume commands
-----------------------
31 To see the list of docker volumes
   docker volume ls

32 To create a new volume
   docker volume create volume_name

33 To remove a volume
   docker volume rm volume_name/volume_id
