Creating a maven project
1 These projects are called artifacts and they are created in   the commnad prompt
  mvn archetype:generate
  This will create a maven project in interactive mode





Adding external dependencies info to pom.xml file
-----------------------------------------------------
1 Open the pom.xml file
2 Go to <dependencies> node
  We will find a dependency related to Junit
  This is the location where we should add all the third party
  dependencies that are required for the developer
3 Open search.maven.org  (maven global server)
4 Search for the external artifact that the developer has asked
5 Copy the dependency info xml code
6 Paste it in pom.xml file in the <dependencies> section
7 Open cmd prompt
8 change dir to the maven project that we created
  cd path_of_maven_project
9 mvn compile
  The above command will download the external artifacts and place them in a folder called .m2 which gets created in users
This .m2 works as the maven local repository
